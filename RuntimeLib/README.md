# The Runtime Library
Hinton provides a collection of built-in functions to help the programmer with writing simpler and efficient programs.

Some of the available built-in functions are
- `print(x: any)` Prints a value to the command line.
- `input(x: String)` Obtains user input from the command line.
- `clock()` Computes the current time in milliseconds. Useful for testing the runtime of a function/program.
