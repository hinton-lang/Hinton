# The Parser

> A parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure â€“ often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while checking for correct syntax

The current grammar rules:
```
program         -> declaration* EOF ;

declaration     -> varDecl
                | constDecl
                | statement ;

varDecl         -> "let" IDENTIFIER ( "=" expression )? ";" ;
constDecl       -> "const" IDENTIFIER "=" expression ";" ;

statement       -> exprStmt
                | printStmt
                | block ;

block           -> "{" declaration* "}" ;

exprStmt        -> expression ";" ;
printStmt       -> "print" "(" expression ")" ";"? ;


expression      -> assignment ;
assignment      -> IDENTIFIER "=" assignment
                | equality ;
equality        -> comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
comparison      -> logic_or ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) logic_or )* ;
logic_or        -> logic_and ("||" logic_and)* ;
logic_and       -> term ("&&" term)* ;
term            -> factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
factor          -> expo ( ( "/" | "*" | "%" ) expo )* ;
expo            -> unary ("**" unary)* ;
unary           -> ( "!" | "-" | "+" ) unary | primary ;

primary         -> INTEGER | REAL | STRING
                | "true" | "false" | "null"
                | "(" expression ")" ;
                | IDENTIFIER ;
