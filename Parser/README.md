# The Parser

> A parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure â€“ often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while checking for correct syntax

The current grammar rules:
```

varDecl         -> "let" IDENTIFIER ( "," IDENTIFIER )* ( "=" expression )? ";" ;
constDecl       -> "const" IDENTIFIER ( "," IDENTIFIER )* "=" expression ";" ;
